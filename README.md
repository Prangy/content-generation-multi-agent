**Summary: Conversational AI Workflow for Information Retrieval and Content Processing**

This project implements a conversational AI workflow designed to facilitate information retrieval from various sources such as the web, blogs, images, and videos, followed by content processing and synthesis. Leveraging a combination of language models, search APIs, and quality assessment tools, the system orchestrates a dialogue between different agents to streamline the information gathering process and generate coherent output.

**Key Features:**

1. **Agent Roles and Responsibilities:**
   - **Web Searcher:** Conducts web searches based on user queries and summarizes the retrieved content.
   - **Web Searcher Quality Agent:** Evaluates the quality of web search results in terms of relevance, grammatical correctness, engagement, harmfulness, and helpfulness.
   - **Blog Searcher:** Searches for relevant blogs or articles based on specified topics and fetches their URLs.
   - **Blog Searcher Quality Agent:** Assesses the quality of blog search results, providing ratings on various criteria similar to the web searcher quality assessment.
   - **Image Generator:** Searches for images related to user queries and retrieves their URLs.
   - **Image Quality Agent:** Evaluates the quality of image search results in terms of relevance, engagement, image quality, and helpfulness.
   - **Content Writer:** Integrates the outputs from various agents, combining information from web searches, blogs, and images to create comprehensive content summaries.

2. **Intelligent Prompting and Workflow Management:**
   - The workflow utilizes intelligent prompts to guide users through the conversational interaction with different agents.
   - A supervisor agent oversees the dialogue flow, determining which agent should take the next action based on the current context and user input.
   - Conditional logic and edge mapping dynamically adapt the workflow, allowing for flexible progression and termination conditions.

3. **Integration with External APIs and Tools:**
   - The system integrates with external APIs such as DuckDuckGo Search and Google Search to retrieve web content, images, and videos.
   - Quality assessment tools evaluate the relevance, correctness, engagement, and helpfulness of search results, providing valuable feedback to users.

4. **Scalability and Extensibility:**
   - The modular design of the system allows for easy integration of additional agents, tools, and APIs to enhance functionality and expand the scope of information retrieval and content processing tasks.
   - Users can customize the workflow by adding or modifying agent roles, adjusting quality assessment criteria, or incorporating new search APIs as needed.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Initiating the Conversation:** Users can initiate the conversation by providing a query or topic of interest. For example, they can ask for information on the latest AI trends in 2024.
2. **Agent Interaction:** The system engages different agents based on the nature of the query, such as web searchers, blog searchers, or image generators. Each agent performs its specific task and provides relevant outputs.
3. **Quality Assessment:** Quality assessment agents evaluate the retrieved content based on predefined criteria and provide feedback on its quality and relevance.
4. **Content Synthesis:** The content writer agent combines the outputs from various sources, including summarized web content, blog URLs, and image URLs, to generate comprehensive content summaries.
5. **Completion and Review:** Once all agents have completed their tasks, users can review the synthesized content and provide feedback or terminate the conversation.

**Contributing and Customization:**

Contributions to the project are welcome, including enhancements to agent functionalities, integration of new APIs or tools, workflow optimizations, and bug fixes. Developers can customize the workflow by adding new agent roles, modifying quality assessment criteria, or integrating additional search APIs to suit specific use cases or domains.
